# javascript-quiz
A Javascript quiz for users to test how strong they know the programming language.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this quiz application to work on my Javascript skills particularly with DOM manipulation, functions, loops, localstorage usage, objects, and much more.
- I created this project to work on my javascript skills particularly with manipulating the DOM, using and manipulating objects, using the local storage, and using functions.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of learning how a quiz application can work in Javascript. I also learned that even simple applications can require a lot of thinking and mapping out.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using javascript in real life applications. Particularly, using 'for' loops, manipulating objects, setting timers, using functions, and scoping
